# PocoCMS: the fastest way to turn Markdown into documentation

PocoCMS is a command-line JamStack utility to let you build documentation websites instantly. It has anywhere from zero to a short learning curve, and will start you off by building a website for you the first time you run it.


PocoCMS is meant to give you the same feeling you had if you created websites in the early days of the Web, because it requires very little tooling and gives you strict control over the output. It speeds things up by using Markdown for text and lets you build or use themes easily.

If you don't want strict control over the output and just want to get some documentation onto the Web, PocoCMS is even more suited to you. Just start writing files in Markup, and PocoCMS will instantly produce something attractive and functional.
